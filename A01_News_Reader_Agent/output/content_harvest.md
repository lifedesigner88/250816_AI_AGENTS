<p>Thailand’s military said on Tuesday that a soldier was wounded by a landmine near the border with Cambodia, the latest in a series of violations of the truce agreed last month.</p>  
<p>The Thai army’s 2nd Army Region spokesperson, Colonel Anan Phuangsub, told reporters the incident happened in the morning in Preah Vihear province, where both sides have accused each other of mine-laying.</p>  
<p>Cambodia’s army dismissed the Thai claim as “fabricated” and said that it had not deployed any mines in the area. “We abide by the ceasefire. This is another attempt by Thailand to shift blame,” said Major General Sok Sopheak, deputy chief of Cambodia’s general staff.</p>  
<p>The border conflict flared in May after a long-standing land dispute over the Preah Vihear temple complex reignited, leading to exchanges of fire, troop buildups and civilian displacements on both sides.</p>  
<p>ASEAN has called on both parties to adhere strictly to the ceasefire, but violations have continued, raising concerns about a renewed escalation in the region.</p>  
<p>International observers have warned that external powers could use the conflict to expand their influence in Southeast Asia, complicating diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis.</p>  
<p>There were no immediate reports of casualties beyond the one soldier, and both sides said they were investigating the incident.</p>  
<p>The truce, brokered by Malaysia’s prime minister in July, has held for the most part but remains fragile as both sides fortify positions and accuse each other of provocations.</p>  
<p>“We want peace, but we are prepared for any challenge,” said Colonel Phuangsub.</p>

<p>BEIJING, Aug 15 (Reuters) – China urged Cambodia and Thailand on Friday to continue efforts to restore a lasting peace at their shared border, state media reported.</p>  
<p>“Both sides should resolve their differences through dialogue and consultation, maintain calm and stability at the border area, and refrain from taking actions that could escalate tensions,” the foreign ministry said in a statement.</p>  
<p>The two Southeast Asian neighbours have been at odds over a land dispute near the Preah Vihear temple complex since May, leading to a fragile ceasefire brokered in July by Malaysia’s prime minister.</p>  
<p>Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet welcomed China’s call, saying it underscored the importance of multilateral diplomacy in defusing regional crises.</p>  
<p>Thailand’s foreign ministry said it welcomed China’s position and reaffirmed its commitment to resolving the issue peacefully.</p>  
<p>There were no immediate signs of new clashes following the statement, but analysts warn that sporadic skirmishes and accusations of ceasefire breaches persist.</p>  
<p>“Sustained dialogue is essential to prevent a relapse into open conflict,” said Li Xing, a Southeast Asia expert at Peking University.</p>  
<p>China has significant economic and strategic interests in Cambodia and Thailand, making it a key player in regional stability efforts.</p>

<p>PHNOM PENH (AP) — Cambodian migrant workers in Thailand are facing renewed uncertainty as tensions flare again at the border, despite a fragile ceasefire brokered last month by Malaysia’s prime minister.</p>  
<p>Hundreds of thousands of Cambodians working in Thailand send billions of dollars home each year, making remittances a critical part of Cambodia’s economy.</p>  
<p>Last week, Thai forces were accused of evicting Cambodian workers from makeshift camps near the border in Preah Vihear province, citing security concerns.</p>  
<p>“They gave us only a few hours to leave,” said Sokha, a 28-year-old construction worker who had been in Thailand for five years. “We had to abandon our belongings and return with nothing.”</p>  
<p>The Phnom Penh government lodged a diplomatic protest, demanding compensation for those affected and assurances that migrants’ rights would be protected.</p>  
<p>Labor activists have called for international monitoring of the situation, warning that thousands of workers could lose livelihoods if tensions persist.</p>  
<p>“The working class should not be caught in political crossfire,” said Chheng Phalla, director of the Cambodian Labour Rights Centre.</p>  
<p>The ceasefire has largely held in military zones, but civilian displacements and property damage have increased, highlighting the human cost of the border dispute.</p>  
<p>“This conflict is not just about territory; it’s about people’s lives,” said foreign policy analyst Sophal Ear. “If the situation worsens, we could see larger refugee flows and economic fallout in the region.”</p>

<p>BANGKOK, Aug 12 (Reuters) – Thailand’s army said on Tuesday one of its soldiers was injured by a landmine near the border with Cambodia in Preah Vihear province.</p>  
<p>The army’s statement said the incident occurred in the morning and blamed Cambodian forces for planting the mine, which they described as a violation of the truce signed in July.</p>  
<p>Cambodia’s defence ministry rejected the claim, saying it had not placed any mines and accused Thailand of staging the incident.</p>  
<p>Both countries agreed to cease hostilities earlier this year under a Malaysian-brokered truce, but sporadic mine-related incidents have been reported on both sides.</p>  
<p>There were no fatalities and the soldier was receiving medical treatment, the statement said.</p>  
<p>Officials from both sides have been meeting under ASEAN’s framework to address border security, but progress has been slow amid mutual distrust.</p>  
<p>“We urge all parties to follow the ceasefire rules and engage constructively,” an ASEAN representative said on condition of anonymity.</p>
