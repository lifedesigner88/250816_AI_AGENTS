<p>Samsung’s Galaxy S25 and Apple’s iPhone 16 are the two biggest smartphone releases of the year. We’ve spent the last week testing both to see which device comes out on top in terms of design, performance, battery life, cameras and ecosystem integration.</p>  
<p>Design and build: Both phones feature an aluminum frame and glass back. Samsung’s handset opts for a slightly larger 6.8-inch AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate, while Apple stays at 6.7 inches but introduces a brighter OLED panel with adaptive refresh.</p>  
<p>Performance: The Galaxy S25 is powered by Samsung’s Exynos 2400 (in most markets) or the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 (in the US), matched with 12GB of RAM. The iPhone 16 runs on Apple’s A18 Bionic chip with 8GB of RAM. In our benchmarks, the iPhone 16 scored 15% higher in single-core CPU tests, but the S25 pulled ahead in GPU-heavy gaming scenarios.</p>  
<p>Battery life: Samsung packs a 5,000mAh battery; Apple uses a 4,400mAh unit. In our 4G video-streaming test, the S25 lasted 12 hours, while the iPhone 16 managed 10.5 hours on Wi-Fi.</p>  
<p>Cameras: The S25’s 108MP primary sensor delivers more detail in bright light, but the iPhone’s new Photonic Engine excels in low-light. Ultrawide shooters are comparable, but Samsung’s 3x telephoto delivers slightly sharper portraits.</p>  
<p>Software & Ecosystem: One UI 6.0 vs iOS 19: Samsung offers more customization and DeX desktop mode, while Apple provides tighter third-party app support and seamless continuity across devices.</p>  
<p>Price: The Galaxy S25 starts at $999, the iPhone 16 at $1,099.</p>  
<p>Verdict: If you value raw performance and ecosystem polish, the iPhone 16 edges out. For display quality, battery life and camera flexibility, the Galaxy S25 is the better buy.</p>

<p>Every year, Samsung and Apple duke it out for smartphone supremacy. This time, the Galaxy S25 and iPhone 16 bring new features that push each company’s hardware and software to the limits. We compared battery life, cameras, displays, and overall user experience to decide which one you should buy.</p>  
<p>Display: The S25’s 6.8-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X offers deeper blacks and HDR10+ support. The iPhone 16’s 6.7-inch Super Retina XDR now peaks at 2,000 nits outdoors, making it easier to see in bright sun.</p>  
<p>Performance: Benchmark scores show a slight advantage for the A18 Bionic in single-core tasks; Samsung’s Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 gets closer in multi-core and GPU tests.</p>  
<p>Battery & Charging: QuickCharge 5 on the S25 delivers 50% in 20 minutes; MagSafe on iPhone 16 is slower at 30% in the same time. Real-world use favors Samsung by about 1.5 hours.</p>  
<p>Cameras: Daylight shots are neck-and-neck. Night mode on the S25 boosts ISO automatically; Apple’s Night mode relies on longer exposures. Portrait mode on both is excellent, though Apple edges out in edge detection.</p>  
<p>Software: One UI vs iOS 19 – two philosophies collide: freedom vs simplicity. Samsung’s software feels more feature-rich, while iOS nails app quality and updates.</p>  
<p>Conclusion: We give the nod to the Galaxy S25 for flexibility, but iPhone 16 remains the go-to for those invested in Apple’s ecosystem.</p>
