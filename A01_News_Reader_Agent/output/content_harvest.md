“PHNOM PENH/ BANGKOK, Sept 28 (Reuters) – Cambodian and Thai troops exchanged mortar and small-arms fire near the border on Sunday, local officials and villagers said, in the latest escalation of a long-running dispute over land and water resources.  
The latest skirmish erupted before dawn in the disputed Preah Vihear province, while both sides accused each other of initiating the attack. Cambodia’s Defense Ministry spokesman, Col. Chum Sitha, said Thai forces opened fire around 5 a.m. local time. Thailand’s Royal Armed Forces insisted Cambodian troops crossed an ‘invisible boundary line’ near the ruins of an ancient Hindu temple…  
Villagers from both sides reported no casualties among civilians, but both militaries confirmed injuries to a handful of soldiers. The border dispute has simmered for decades, flaring into violence sporadically despite diplomatic efforts led by ASEAN and the United Nations. Cambodia accused Thailand of aggressive patrolling, while Thailand pointed to new Cambodian bunkers in the contested zone.  
Analysts warn that nationalistic sentiment in both countries could complicate any negotiated settlement, as local elections loom in Thailand next month. Cambodia has sought support from China, while Thailand has deep defense ties with the United States. Both capitals have convened emergency security meetings as tensions rise.

“PHNOM PENH (AP) — Armed forces of Cambodia and Thailand traded gunfire Saturday along their disputed border stretching through dense jungle and farmland. Residents described a sudden barrage of artillery shells that shook homes in the border villages.  
According to Khmer officials, Thai forces fired first after accusing a Cambodian patrol of crossing an invisible line in Preah Vihear province. A Thai military spokesperson claimed that Cambodian troops had destroyed a Thai observation post.  
Witnesses said at least two villagers on the Cambodian side sustained shrapnel injuries, and three Thai soldiers were slightly wounded. Both governments have blamed each other on social media and summoned senior diplomats to lodge protests. The military standoff cut power and communications in several border hamlets, officials said.  
Analysts say the land-mine-laden frontier, a relic of past conflicts, has become a recurring flashpoint as both nations seek to assert control over contested farmland and water wells. Cambodian villagers reported digging new trenches as Thai armor conducted night-time drills nearby.  
Efforts by ASEAN to mediate have so far failed to produce a lasting ceasefire. International human rights groups have called for restraint and urged both sides to resume negotiations under UN supervision to prevent displacement and damage to cultural heritage sites.”

## Article 3: Deadly Clashes Along Cambodia-Thailand Border Raise Fears of Wider Conflict

“In the pre-dawn haze of Saturday, Cambodian and Thai border guards engaged in fierce firefights near the Preah Vihear temple ruins, an area long contested by the two nations. At least five soldiers were killed and a dozen wounded on both sides, according to local health officials.  
Experts point to rising nationalism in both capitals, driven by upcoming elections in Thailand and a push for sovereign integrity by Cambodia’s ruling party. The disputed territory, rich in limestone caves and water sources, has become a powerful symbol for both governments.  
‘This is not a simple boundary dispute,’ said Dr. Sophal Ear, a political scientist at Georgetown University. ‘It has become a symbol of nationalism, and neither side can afford to look weak.’  
ASEAN leaders convened an emergency virtual meeting Sunday, urging both sides to halt fire and return to talks mediated by Vietnamese and Indonesian envoys. Meanwhile, villagers caught in the crossfire described hiding in rice paddies as shells exploded overhead.  
Humanitarian agencies warned of potential displacement if hostilities continue, calling for immediate delivery of food, water, and medical supplies to isolated villages. Cultural experts also expressed alarm over possible damage to Preah Vihear, a UNESCO World Heritage site.”

## Article 4: Cambodia and Thailand Trade Fire in Latest Border Dispute

“Cambodia and Thailand have exchanged gun and artillery fire in the latest outbreak of violence along their unsettled border. The clashes occurred near Preah Vihear, a World Heritage site which has been a flashpoint since the 1960s.  
The Thai Defence Ministry reported that three soldiers were wounded when Cambodian troops launched a mortar attack just before dawn, while Cambodia’s military spokesman confirmed two of its soldiers were injured by return fire. Both sides accused the other of violating a buffer zone established decades ago.  
BBC correspondents say the border is heavily mined, complicating efforts to patrol and negotiate. The temple itself was handed over to Cambodia by a 1962 International Court of Justice ruling, but Thailand has objected to the extent of the surrounding buffer zone.  
This latest incident comes amid heightened military exercises by both nations. Analysts warn the risk of escalation could draw in major powers: China has sold Cambodia advanced air-defence systems, and the US has increased security cooperation with Thailand.  
‘A full-fledged war is unlikely,’ says military analyst Jonathan Head, ‘but repeated skirmishes risk creating a cycle of retaliation that could spiral out of control.’
