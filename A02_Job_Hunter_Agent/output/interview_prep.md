## Concepts To Know/Review
- Advanced React patterns: Hooks (useMemo, useCallback), context vs. Redux, code-splitting  
- TypeScript: Generics, utility types (Partial, Pick, Omit), discriminated unions  
- GraphQL: Schema design, queries vs. mutations, caching policies (Apollo Client)  
- Testing: Jest mocks, snapshot tests, RTL queries, Cypress for E2E  
- Front-end Architecture: Component libraries, micro-frontends, performance optimization  
- CI/CD & Cloud: GitHub Actions, Docker basics, AWS S3/CloudFront deployments  
- Remote Collaboration Tools: Jira, Slack, Confluence, Git workflows  

## Strategic Advice
- **Tone & Delivery:** Confident and concise; showcase thought process out loud when problem-solving.  
- **Focus Areas:** Emphasize scalable architecture decisions, test coverage discipline, and cross-team communication.  
- **Storytelling:** Use STAR format for behavioral: highlight impact metrics (bundle-size reduction, coverage %, defect reduction).  
- **Red Flags to Avoid:**  
  - Over-claiming on GraphQL schema design—be honest about collaboration with backend.  
  - Minimizing remote communication challenges—instead, show proactive solutions.  
- **Closing Tactics:** Reiterate alignment with company values (innovation, collaboration), clarify next steps, and express enthusiasm for InsightAI’s roadmap.
