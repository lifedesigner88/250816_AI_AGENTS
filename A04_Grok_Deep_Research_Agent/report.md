# Research Report: Recent Developments in Nuclear Energy (2023)

## Executive Summary
Recent advancements in nuclear energy are poised to transform the energy landscape, driven by technological innovations, supportive policies, and a re-emphasis on nuclear as a key player in the fight against climate change. Key findings from 2023 include:
- The entry of new advanced reactors such as Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) and the first commercial operation of the Vogtle 3 reactor in the U.S.
- A global commitment to tripling nuclear energy capacity by 2050 with 31 countries pledging support at the COP28 conference.
- Significant investment and policy support from global leaders are directed towards nuclear energy as part of broader climate goals, with expectations for substantial capacity increases through new technologies.

## Background & Current State
The nuclear energy sector, which currently contributes about 9% of global electricity and a quarter of all low-carbon electricity, is undergoing significant change:
- As of 2023, nuclear power production rose by 2.6% from the previous year, maintaining a crucial role in global energy supply.
- The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reported that the median capacity factor of nuclear reactors has reached 88%, indicating efficient utilization of existing capacity.
- High levels of reactor construction are reported in China, with 27 under development, while the U.S. focuses on revitalizing its nuclear sector through technological innovation and regulatory reforms.

## Analysis & Insights
Major trends in the nuclear sector reveal a conscious pivot towards advanced reactors, nuclear hydrogen production, and international collaborations:
1. **Advanced Nuclear Technologies**: Technologies like SMRs and high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) reactors are emerging as leaders in modernization efforts. The NuScale Power module has become the first SMR design certified amidst growing interest.
2. **Investment Trends**: Global investment in nuclear is projected to grow significantly, driven by initiatives in advanced economies, with investments expected to exceed USD 150 billion annually by 2030 under optimistic scenarios.
3. **Environmental and Energy Security Impacts**: Nuclear energy¡¯s potential to decarbonize hard-to-abate sectors, including industrial processes and hydrogen production, is increasingly recognized as a critical driver for renewable integration.

## Future Outlook
Nuclear energy is expected to play a vital role in meeting projected energy demands as overall electricity requirements grow:
- Predictions anticipate that nuclear capacity could exceed 1,000 GW by 2050, driven by SMRs and new generation technologies.
- The geopolitical implications of nuclear energy expansion include reshaping global energy dependencies and influencing international relations between energy-importing and exporting nations.
- Innovations and collaborations in nuclear power, particularly those involving AI and digital technologies, will likely accelerate commercialization and operational efficiency.
